# WebsiteClassification

### Usage

Download website data using followed command.

```sh
$ python load_data.py
```

Then, you will see the "preprocessed.pickle" in current directory.


In order to categorize libraries, you can use the following command.
```sh
$ python run_py.py
```

### Notes
- I eliminated some of categories for experimental purposes. (modify run.py, if necessay )
- You can extend dataset.csv to increase the score, i.e. accuracy.
